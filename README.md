Constellation
======

Constellation is a modern, scalable solution for managing your log files
across several servers and by many users.

It uses the well-known wide-column store Cassandra for saving log entries and provides an
easy-to-use web application, written in Ruby on Rails, for monitoring and controlling.

Usage
======

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
======

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
